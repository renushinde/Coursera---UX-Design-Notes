 This week's focus is on craft user stories and develop user journey maps and learn about the importance of considering accessibility when empathizing with users.
 ## User Story
 An user story is a fictional one line statemnt story told from persons's point of view to inspire and inform design decisons.  
 User story = Hero + Goal + Conflict. 
 for E.g "As a team manager, I want to streamline administrative processes so that my employees remain productive." This user story is complete with a type of user, action, and benefit. A complete user story keeps the problem user-centered, actionable, and clear.
 
 Or "As a mom to 2 homeschoolers, I want to find playdates for kids closer to us so they can my kids can improve on social skills."
