### I'm very excited to start this course. The week 1 is focused on the basics of UX design.

## User Experience
User Experience is how a user feels, interacts with a product. User Experience design is a user- centered approach to solving design problems. 
A product is a good, service or a feature. 

## To have a better User Experience, a product needs to be - 
  . Equitable - Considering unique needs of multiple users is important and equitable design is the key. Eg, Voice assistant. 
  
  . Usable - The design, purpose of the product should be clear to everyone. Eg a ketchup bottle.
  
  . Enjoyable - Creates a positive connection between a user and product. We can make more informed choices. Eg, when ordering food from Yelp, there are photos of the dishes. 
  
  . Useful - A product has to solve the problem. Eg, Google maps. 
  
 ## Why is UX important?
 Regardless of industries, business that focuses on good usability and designs perform better than their competetors.
