## Design Sprint - how does a design goes into a product?

A design sprint is a time-bound process with five phases typically spread out over five full, eight-hour days.
A design sprint can answer critical business questins to design challenges. The goal of design sprints is to solve a critical design challenge through designing, prototyping, and testing ideas with users.

## Why do we need Design Sprint?
* Sprint saves time.
* It creates a path to bring a product in market. 
* Prioritize the user.  Sprint puts users front and center. 
* Sprints allow you to fast forward into the future to test your product and get customer reactions before making any expensive decisions.
* Sprints are versatile, they can be scheduled at any point during a project. 
* It values every person in the room.

## When to Sprint?
* Are there many solutions to a design challenge?
* Does design challenge require pople from cross functional team?
* Is the design challenge scope wide enough?

## Five phases of Sprint
* Understand - In this phase there's lots of discussion between cross functional teams and experts to understand what the problem is? Always putting user at front.
* Ideate - In this phase, teams decide different solutions to the design challenge. 
* Decide - One solution is finalises in this phase. 
* Prototype - step by step prototype is made to test with real users.
* Test - In this phase the prototype is shown to different users and we get feedback.  

## Plan a Design Sprint 
* Research
* Talk with experts as it'll be useful for the understand phase 
* Find the right space - whiteboards, sticky notes, markers, comfortable furnitures to move around.
* Gather supplies
* Rules like no gadgets.
* Plan instructions. 

## What should be covered in the logistics section of a design sprint brief? 

* Key deliverables and objectives to meet at the end of the sprint
* Current state of the project and estimated launch plan
* Where and when the sprint will happen
* Name of sprint master and list of attendees
